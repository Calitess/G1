  Claude:	And you said you weren't going to put anything in it. 
  Manaia:	It wasn't me. 
  Manaia:	Something else is going on here.

title: Scene11
---
Niamh:	Have you ever thought of doing something else?
Manaia:	What do you mean?
Niamh:	All we do is pack cargo, go home, sleep, repeat. Ad infinitum. 

Niamh:	Don’t you want something different? Something more? 
Manaia:	 I like the life we have.
Niamh:	There’s the entire world out there, and we never get to see it. 
Niamh:	Only if you’re a helmsman. 
Niamh:	Or you’re lucky enough to work for a Fluer du Cielian. Or… I don’t know. 
Niamh:	Go rogue. Become a Sky Mule. 
Manaia:	What are you saying?
Niamh:	Think about it. They’re free to do whatever they want. 

Niamh:	No enforcers telling them what to do. When to work. Where to be. 
Niamh:	We could leave Mórport. The three of us. 
Manaia:	A Sky Mule? Niamh, they’re robbers. 
Manaia:	Murderers. 
Manaia:	They’re the reason so many people disappear in the fog. 
Niamh:	That’s just what the enforcers say. 
Niamh:	People go missing because they have shit guides. 
Niamh:	Who can’t operate a compass to save their life. 
Manaia:	You seriously want to become a Sky Mule? Why? 
Niamh:	What? No. No, I don’t—
Niamh:	I just want us to get out of here. Together. 
Niamh:	 Listen, I’ve been talking to a helmsman. 
Niamh:	I took one of the tiny, wrecked postal ships. I fixed it and I got him to teach me to use the compass. 
Niamh:	I’ve been riding with him, learning the ropes and I’m ready. 
Niamh:	We can do it. We can. 
Manaia:	You stole an airship?
Manaia:	We could get put away for life. 
Manaia:	Did you even think about that?
Niamh:	We won’t. I know what I’m doing. 
Manaia:	You need to bring it back. 
Niamh:	I wasn’t—
Niamh:	I thought you’d be excited 
Niamh:	You love reading about scenarios just like this. Traveling to far places, seeing more than just the cold machinery and smoke. 
Niamh:	Getting away from the humdrum.
Manaia:	It's never been boring with you. 
	...
Manaia:	You and Fionn.
Niamh:	Then come with me. 
Niamh:	Look, I’ve already planned it out. 
Niamh:	I know it’s soon, but they won’t be checking up on us in a while. 
Niamh:	The ship's behind the landfill, I want you to meet me there tonight. 
Niamh:	Be there twenty minutes before curfew. 
Manaia:	I’m not leaving. 
Niamh:	We can’t miss this. 
Niamh:	Eventually they’ll come looking for the ship. 
Niamh:	I’ll wait for you.

Manaia:	Why am I seeing this memory?
Manaia:	I’m sorry Niamh. 
Manaia:	I should have stopped you. 
	...
Manaia:	What happened to you?
